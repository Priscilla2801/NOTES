GNU PROJECT/ GPL LICENSING:
	
	1983 -> GNU("GNU's not UNIX")
	Started by Richard Stallman
	GNU -> open source OS.
	 Combines with LINUX and Kernel to form an Operating System.

LINUX - Kernel:
	
	1991 founded by Linux Jorvalds. Version: 0.01
	 Linux and GNU formed the first open source Operating System.

Distribution in LINUX:
	
	Redhat -> Networking and administration
	Ubuntu -> Embedded Systems
	Fedora -> Education
	Linux sugar -> Gaming

LINUX - 
		Monolithic Kernel based Os.
		Micro Kernel based Os.

Working of LINUX:
	
	User program / code --> Kernel mode --> Hardware

LINUX Shell Command:
	
	Path: 
			Relative path --  :~$cd ./d1/d2/d3  --> Current Directory

			 Absolute path -- From root till the destination.
		mkdir -- to make directory
		cd -- to move into the directory
		cd . -- current directory
		cd .. -- comes out of the directory
		rm -- remove
		rm -rf -- recursive forcefully
TREE:
	To install tree and to view the directories and files in tree structure:

		sudo apt-get install tree
		 tree > tree_file
		 vim tree_file

Internal Commands:

Internal commands are built-in functionalities of the shell (e.g., Bash) itself.
These commands are executed directly by the shell without invoking an external program.
Since they are part of the shell, they execute more quickly and efficiently than external commands.
Examples of internal commands include cd, echo, pwd, history, alias, and exit.

External Commands:

External commands are standalone executable programs stored in the system's file system.
When you execute an external command, the shell searches for the command in directories listed in the PATH environment variable.
These commands are separate programs that run in their own processes.
External commands may offer more advanced functionality and capabilities compared to internal commands.
Examples of external commands include ls, grep, cat, cp, mv, rm, and mkdir.
