
RAM:
•	Primary Memory Storage.
•	They are of two types:
•	Static RAM – Made of Flip Flop
•	Dynamic RAM – Made of Capasitors
•	Static RAM is faster than Dynamic RAM
ARM:
	Cortex A -> Application
	Cortex R -> Real Time Application
	Cortex M -> Microcontroller 

BUS:
o	Used to communicate between CPU and Computer.
o	Peripherals – GPIO (To communicate outside the environment.
o	These are sent by  ‘System Bus’[S bus]
o	AHB1 -> 180 MHz (Maximum)
o	AHB/APB1 and AHB/APB2 are two types is AHB1.
GPIO:
o	Reading Digital Signals -> Input Device
o	Issuing Interrupts
o	Generating triggers for external components -> Output Device
o	Generic Pin: Value consists of one or two voltage settings(high or low). Behaviour can be programmed using software.
o	Generic Port: All the pins are connected to the port
o	Multiplexing: This behaviour can be seen in pins as they possess multiple process at a time.
o	Input Mode: We use Internal Pull Up or Internal Pull Down
o	Output mode: We use the Pull Up Register always gives 0 . Gate Drain Source(GDS). Open Drain State can also be used.
o	Clock is known as the heartbeat. Enable the clock to access the pin.
o	Memory Mapped I/O: Uses memory to access the I/O by making partition in memory with address.
o	Registers -> Structure -> Type def -> Made as structure pointer -> Named as RCC.
o	AHB1ENR is known as the member.
