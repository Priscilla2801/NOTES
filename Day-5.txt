The way to boot and to mount the root files is known as the Porting.

Procedure:
SOC  ->  has a board & flashed  ->  Boot ROM  ->  Searches the at91 boot strap  ->  
SRAM(Loads the at91 boot strap code)  ->  Goes t RAM and initializes  ->  Loads the U boot 
code to RAM  ->  u boot loads the .dtb file & zimage to RAM  -> RFS then mounts the root file 
system.
