UART
•	Serial communication: 8-bit data is transferred one bit at a time.
•	Parallel communication: 8-bit data is transferred at the same time.
•	MSB :- Most Significant Bit ,  LSB :- Least Significant Bit.
•	The MSB or LSB which will be called or used first it depends on the protocol i.e. the rules given by the user.
•	Serial Communication is of two types:
	Synchronous			
	Asynchronous
Synchronous: Clock is transmitted with data
Asynchronous: No clock is transmitted. Transmitter and receiver agree on the clock speed for the data transmission.
UART:-
	Serial communication uses asynchronous. It can also be synchronous.
	UART – Universal Asynchronous Receiver/ Transmitter
	USART – Universal Synchronous Receiver/ Transmitter 
Duplex:  Data can be transmitted and received.
Simplex: Data can be transmitted only or received only.
Half Duplex: Data can be transmitted in only one way at a time.
Full Duplex: Data can be transmitted  in both ways at a time.
	UART follows Full Duplex.
Asynchronous Transmission:
 Each byte is packed between the start and stop bits. 
Start Bit  has the value of 1 bit and is always 0.
Stop bit can have 2 bit at most and 1 bit at the minimum else it’s a 1 ½ bit and its value is always 1.
Parity bit:- The parity bit is a simple form of error detection used in serial communication protocols like UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter)
Mode:- Receiver and Transmitter.
Word Length:- 8 bit or 16 bit.
