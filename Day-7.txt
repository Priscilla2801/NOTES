CISC - Complex Instrction Set Architecture
RISC - Reduced Instruction Set Architecture
 	
	The processor that could delier both high performance and energy efficient tend to the creation of the arm processor.
ARM:-
	Instruction Set
	Register Set
	Exception Model
	Memory Model
	Debug,Trace and Profiling
RISC:-
	Simple isntruction
	Simple Addressing Modes
	Load Store Architecture
MICRO ARCHITECTURE:-
	Build and Design of a processor is referred as mcro architecture. Includes:
		Pipeline length and layout
		Number and sizes of caches
		Cycle counts for individual instructions
		Which optional features are implemented
IP - CORE:-
	IP Core = Implementation in VHDL or Verilog of a block of hardware logic.
	ARM develops IP core which implements the specification
PROCESSOR FAMILY:-
	ARM processor families group multiple processors and was named chronologically,starting with ARM1(1985) upto ARM11(2002)
	Naming scheme then changed with the cortex family introduced in 2005, in which processor are named with the following scheme cortex( Cortex M4)
	Each new family introduced new processors, with an improved design, better performance and new features.	
	'F' - VFP floating point unit
	'T' or 'T2' - Thumb or Thumb2 instruction encoding
	'J' - Jazette
	'Z' - Trustzone Extension.
